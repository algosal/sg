## About SG CLI

**SG CLI** is a powerful command-line interface created by Salman Saeed. It combines the familiar folder structure and command patterns from **Angular** with the modern principles of **React** and **Vite**, providing a ready-to-use boilerplate for web applications.

SG CLI comes with built-in navigation and project scaffolding, reducing setup overhead and making it ideal for developing regular applications efficiently.
